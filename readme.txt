Allow multiple user accounts to be created from the same email address.

== Description ==

Allow multiple user accounts to be created from the same email address.

By default, WordPress only allows a single user account to be associated with a specific email address.  This plugin removes that restriction.

An admin settings page (accessed via Users -> Multiple Accounts or via the Settings link next to the plugin on the Manage Plugins page) is also provided to allow only certain email addresses the ability to have multiple accounts (such as if you only want admins to have that ability).  You may also specify a limit to the number of accounts an email address can have.

The settings page for the plugin also provides a table listing all user accounts, grouped by the email address (see screenshot).


== Installation ==

1. Unzip `allow-multiple-accounts-v1.0.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. Optionally go to the Users -> Multiple Accounts admin settings page (which you can also get to via the Settings link next to the plugin on the Manage Plugins page) and configure settings.

== Screenshots ==

1. A screenshot of the plugin's admin settings page.
